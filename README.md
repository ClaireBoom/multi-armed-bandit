# Project Description

I completed this independent study project over the course of two semesters my junior year at Cal Lutheran University (2018-2019). Dr. Christopher Brown was my advisor. I chose to utilize Python for this project because I thought a high-level language would be appropriate for the algorithms and I wanted to expand upon my Python knowledge. I spent on average 8 hours a week throughout the school year researching and optimizing reinforced learning algorithms for this project. A detailed description of the setup and procedure for this project can be found in the '.ipynb' file.
